#Bulk update all course grading policies to manual
This script was made to use a headless browser to crawl through a canvas site and update all course grading policies manually based on a list of course SIS IDs. 

The headless browser approach was used because there was no way to do this through the api at the point of this script being written (hopefully there is something in the future).

Make sure you have installed NodeJS and the script dependencies before running the script otherwise you will get errors!


## Support
This script is provided AS-IS, without warranty, and without any support beyond this
document and anyone kind enough to help from the community.

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be
able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support
and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
